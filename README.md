### Status

SocketStream 0.3 is in full time development, rapidly progressing thanks to frequent contributions from a growing community.

This is a working alpha release intended for experimentation and use by early adopters. There is still [plenty of work](https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream/blob/master/TODO.md) to do to finish features and improve existing code; however, most of the server-side API is now stable.

Please share your thoughts on our [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/socketstream) after reading [TODO.md](https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream/blob/master/TODO.md) (updated regularly).

The previous stable version of SocketStream can be found in the [0.2 branch](https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream/tree/0.2). This is the version currently on NPM.


### Introduction

SocketStream is a new 100% open source Node.js web framework dedicated to building **single-page realtime apps**.

It does away with old ideas such as routing, AJAX, partials and polling by sending and receiving all application data over the websocket at lightning speed. Requests to the server can be sent using modular Request Handlers (such as the [RPC](https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream/blob/master/doc/guide/en/rpc_responder.md) and forthcoming Model handlers), whilst incoming data can be transformed into HTML using fast, flexible [client-side templates](https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream/blob/master/doc/guide/en/client_side_templates.md).

SocketStream provides structure for your client asset files, supporting optional code formatters (such as [Stylus](https://github.com/socketstream/ss-stylus) for CSS) whilst making it easy to send a different mix of assets to iPhones and other clients. It will even [reload the browser](https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream/blob/master/doc/guide/en/live_reload.md) for you whenever a client file changes. Once you go into production, all asset files are automatically packed and minified into one `.js` and one `.css` file.

On the server-side, SocketStream shares [sessions](https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream/blob/master/doc/guide/en/sessions.md) across HTTP and Websocket requests (making it easy to implement [authentication](https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream/blob/master/doc/guide/en/authentication.md)) and supports powerful custom-defined [request middleware](https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream/blob/master/doc/guide/en/request_middleware.md) which can be chained together. An optional [console](https://github.com/socketstream/ss-console) module allows you to connect to any running server to test RPC methods or publish events.

While all this may initially sound like the typical monolithic black box framework of the past, nothing could be further from the truth. SocketStream's real killer feature is that it puts **your** application at the heart of things by creating an `app.js` file which you run like any other Node.js app. This means it's easy to integrate with other great modules such as [Express.js](http://expressjs.com), [Everyauth](https://github.com/bnoguchi/everyauth) and [thousands](http://search.npmjs.org) more - so you're never trapped into **our** way of doing anything.

We think this is revolution in web development. We'd love you give it a go and let us know what you think.


## Main Features

#### General

* Designed for large apps - excellent code organization, modularity and extensibility. Not a black box framework
* True bi-directional communication using websockets (or [Socket.IO 0.8](http://socket.io) fallbacks). No more slow, messy AJAX!
* Write all code in [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) or JavaScript - your choice
* **NEW** Works great with [Express.js](http://expressjs.com) and other Connect-based frameworks!
* Easily share code between the client and server. Ideal for business logic and model validation (see Questions below)
* **NEW** Request Middleware - enabling session access, authentication, logging, distributed requests and more
* Effortless, scalable, pub/sub baked right in - including Private Channels
* **NEW** Easy authentication - use a backend databases or authenticate against Facebook Connect, Twitter, etc using [Everyauth](https://github.com/bnoguchi/everyauth)
* **NEW** Share sessions between HTTP and Websocket Requests using Connect Session Stores
* Optionally use [Redis](http://www.redis.io) for fast session retrieval, pub/sub, list of users online, and any other data your app needs instantly
* **NEW** Modular transport design allow alternative websocket or back-end event transports to be used
* API Trees - offer a simple, consistent way to namespace and organize large code bases
* Uses [Connect 2.0](http://senchalabs.github.com/connect/) - hook in 3rd-party HTTP middleware or write your own
* MIT License

#### Client Side

* Works great with Chrome, Safari __and now Firefox 6__ using native websockets
* Compatible with older versions of Firefox and IE thanks to configurable fallback transports provided by Socket.IO
* **NEW** Define multiple single-page clients by choosing the CSS, JS and client-side templates you wish to serve
* Integrated asset manager - automatically packages and [minifies](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) all client-side assets
* **NEW** Live Reload - automatically reloads the browser when HTML, CSS or JS client files change
* Works with iPads and iPhones using Mobile Safari (iOS 4.2 and above), even over 3G. Send a smaller, lighter client if desired
* Multiple clients work seamlessly with HTML Push State 'mock routing' so you can use [Backbone Router](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Router), [Davis JS](http://davisjs.com) and more
* **NEW** Supports many client-side template languages (Hogan/Mustache/CoffeeKup/jQuery), pre-compiling them for speed
* **NEW** Works great with [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com) for 'reactive templates' which automatically update when data changes 
* Bundled with jQuery - though not dependent on it. Will work great with Zepto and other libraries
* Easily add additional client libraries such as [Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/)
* Highly Experimental: Designate client-side code files as modules and require() them as you would server-side code

#### Optional Modules (officially maintained and supported)

* **[ss-console](https://github.com/socketstream/ss-console)** Connect to a live server and call RPC actions or publish events over the REPL / terminal
* Code Formatters: **[ss-coffee](https://github.com/socketstream/ss-coffee)** (CoffeeScript), **[ss-jade](https://github.com/socketstream/ss-jade)** Jade (for HTML), **[ss-stylus](https://github.com/socketstream/ss-stylus)** Stylus (for CSS), **[ss-less](https://github.com/socketstream/ss-less)** Less (for CSS)

### Getting Started

Ready to give it a whirl? Install [Node 0.6.X](http://nodejs.org/#download) then clone the project locally (just until 0.3.0 is released and published to `npm`):

    git clone https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream.git
    cd socketstream
    sudo npm link

To generate a new empty SocketStream project type:

    socketstream new <name_of_your_project>

Install the bundled (optional) dependencies:

    cd <name_of_your_project>
    npm install
    npm link socketstream

To start your app simply type:

    node app.js
    
If all goes well you'll see the SocketStream banner coming up, then you're ready to visit your new app at:

    http://localhost:3000

Note: We are aware there is a strange mix of JavaScript/CoffeeScript created at the moment. This will be fixed shortly. The plan is to create vanilla JS files by default with the ability to type `socketstream new -c <name_of_your_project>` if you prefer to use CoffeeScript.


### How does it work?

SocketStream automatically compresses and minifies all the static HTML, CSS and client-side code your app will ever need and sends this through the first time a user visits your site.

From then on all application data is sent and received via the websocket (or Socket.IO fallbacks), instantly established when the client connects and automatically re-established if broken. Normally this will be in JSON RPC format, but SocketStream 0.3 allows you to use different message responders depending upon the task at hand.

All this means no more connection latency, HTTP header overhead, or clunky AJAX calls. Just true bi-directional, asynchronous, 'streaming' communication between client and server.


### What can I create with it?

SocketStream is a perfect fit for all manner of modern applications which require real-time data (chat, stock trading, location monitoring, analytics, etc). It's also a great platform for building real-time HTML5 games. However, right now it would make a poor choice for a blog or other content-rich site which requires unique URLs for search engine optimization.


### Demo Apps

SocketStream 0.3 example apps coming soon!


### Example 1: Basic RPC

SocketStream 0.3 supports multiple ways to send messages to and from the server. The most common of which, JSON-over-RPC, is included by default. An RPC call can be invoked on the server by calling `ss.rpc()` in the browser.

For example, let's write a simple server-side function which squares a number. Make a file called `server/rpc/app.js` and put this in it:

``` javascript
// server/rpc/app.js
exports.actions = function(req, res, ss){

  // return list of actions which can be called publicly
  return {

    square: function(number){
      res(number * number);
    }

  }
}
```

Restart the server and then invoke this function from the brower's command line:

``` javascript
ss.rpc('app.square', 25)
```

You'll see the answer `625` logged to the console by default. The eagle-eyed among you will notice `ss.rpc('app.square', 25)` actually returned `undefined`. That's fine. We're only interested in the asynchronous response sent from the server once it has processed your request.

Now let's write some code in the client to do more with this response. Make a file called `client/code/main/app.js` and put this in it:

``` javascript
// client/code/main/app.js

// define the number to square (vars are local to this file by default)
var number = 25;

// ensure SocketStream has connected to the server
SocketStream.event.on('ready', function(){

  ss.rpc('app.square', number, function(response){
    alert(number + ' squared is ' + response);
  });

});
```

Refresh the page and you'll see an alert box popup with the following:

    25 squared is 625
    
More examples coming soon!

### Questions?

##### How can I make my app auto-restart when /server code changes?

Install the excellent 'nodemon' module with `sudo npm install -g nodemon` then start your app with `nodemon app.js`. A `.nodemonignore` file has already been created for you with the optimal settings. This feature is very useful when developing your app.

##### How can I configure Socket.IO?

Like so:

```javascript
ss.ws.transport.use('socketio', {io: function(io){
  io.set('log level', 4)
}});
```

##### Will it run on Windows?

Yes. We have several users running SocketStream on Windows without problems. Please see the Windows installation instructions in INSTALL.md


##### How can I share code between client and server?

After much thought we decided to abandon the app/shared directory concept in SocketStream 0.2. Thankfully now that we support client-side modules there is a cleaner alternative:

Make the code you wish to share a module (by exporting functions and vars) and save it in `client/code/modules`. You can then `require()` the module in both your client-side and server-side code.


##### Does SocketStream support models?

Not yet. Right now we only support RPC calls and Events. However, websocket middleware and modular websocket responders were introduced in 0.3 to encourage people to start experimenting with different ways to define, access and sync models over websockets. If and when good contributed solutions exist we will promote them here. Models will be our primary focus for the next major release.


##### Should I use Redis?

Yes. SocketStream installs the Redis driver by default but does not require Redis to be running when developing your app (for convenience sake). However, as soon as you want to host your app for real, you need to be using Redis.

Redis is used in two areas of SocketStream - session storage and internal pubsub (used by ss.publish commands). You can enable Redis in your app with the following commands in your app.js file:

    ss.session.store.use('redis');
    ss.publish.transport.use('redis');

Pass any config as the second argument to either of the above commands as so:

    {host: 'localhost', port: 6379}


##### How about scaling?

SocketStream 0.3 makes a big assumption in order to maximize speed and reduce code complexity: All incoming connections with the same session should be routed to the same server (also known as Sticky Sessions). The session details are stored in memory and then optionally saved to Redis to preserve the session should the node fail.

Front end scaling can be achieved using a combination of different websocket transports (such as the bundled Pusher Pipe) and optional features we intend to introduce in the future.

Back end scaling has yet to be properly documented, but we're keen to continue looking into ways to use ZeroMQ and also Hook IO. We will make sure back end scaling is as easy and flexible as possible, but it will no longer be a feature of the framework itself.


##### Why not use Require.js, AMD or Browserify?

Right now we're starting off with a much more lightweight solution (about 5 lines of code) which behaves identically to the require() command server-side (at least it will once we implement relative ./ ../ paths). It is not a perfect solution yet but it feels like the right direction to go in given SocketStream already takes care of all the bundling. We will fully document client-side module loading soon.


### Developing on the SocketStream core

SocketStream is primarily written in CoffeeScript which is 'pre-compiled' into JavaScript using `make build`. If you're actively developing on the code make sure you install the dev dependencies first (just clone the project and type `sudo npm link`).

To avoid having to continually type `make build` every time you make a change, pass the `SS_DEV=1` environment variable when running your SocketStream app:

    $ SS_DEV=1 node app.js

Your app will then directly read code from your local SocketStream repository's /src directory. This means when you make changes to the SocketStream core, you only need to restart your app to see them.


### Testing

There are a number of [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) tests starting to appear for parts of the API which are unlikely to change. To run them type:

    $ make test
    
More tests coming soon. Contributions very much appreciated.
