# Sessions

SocketStream uses the Connect Session Store to ensure sessions can be easily shared between HTTP and Websocket requests using a similar API.

This means you're able to write data to a session from SocketStream and then use it in Express.js or any other page-based framework which uses Connect - especially useful when performing authentication.


### Using Sessions over Websockets

For optimum speed and flexibility, session data is not retrieved by default when a websocket request is processed by the server. Before you do anything with sessions, you'll need to activate the internal `session` [Request Middleware](https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream/blob/master/doc/guide/en/request_middleware.md) as shown below:

``` javascript
// server/rpc/app.js
exports.actions = function(req, res, ss){

  // Load session data into req.session 
  req.use('session');

  return {

    testAction: function(){
      console.log('This request now has session data:', req.session);
    }

  }
}
```

#### Getting/Setting Custom Session Data

``` javascript
// server/rpc/app.js
exports.actions = function(req, res, ss){

  // Load session data into req.session 
  req.use('session');

  return {

    getSession: function() {
      console.log('The contents of my session is', req.session);
    },

    updateSession: function(){
      req.session.myVar = 1234;
      req.session.cart = {items: 3, checkout: false};
      req.session.save(function(err){
        console.log('Session data has been saved:', req.session); 
      });

    }

  }
}
```

### Using Sessions over HTTP

The same session data is automatically loaded into `req.session` when accessed over HTTP. For example, append this route to your `app.js` file:

``` javascript
// app.js
ss.http.router.on('/updateSession', function(req, res) {
  req.session.myVar = 4321;
  res.end('req.session.myVar has been updated to', req.session.myVar);
});
```

Note: There is no need to call `req.session.save()` if you're calling `res.end()`.


### Session Stores

The in-memory Connect Session Store is used by default to allow you to start developing easily. Before your app goes into production you **must** use a Connect Session Store with a persistent backend to avoid memory leaks.

We have bundled the `connect-redis` store as standard as this makes an excellent choice. To use it, add the following line to your `app.js` file:

``` javascript
ss.session.store.use('redis');
```

Any Redis configuration can be passed to the second argument (e.g `{port: 1234}`).


### Auto-expiring Sessions

By default sessions will expire within 30 days, unless the session is terminated beforehand (e.g. the user closes the browser). To set a different expiry time put the following in your `app.js` file:

``` javascript
ss.session.options.maxAge = 8640000;  // one day in milliseconds
```

### Custom Session Cookie Name

By default a session cookie is saved as `connect.sid` on the client's browser. To set a custom cookie name put the following in your `app.js` file:

``` javascript
ss.session.options.key = "MyCustomApp";
```
