# Template Engine Wrappers

Building your own template engine wrapper is easy. For this quick tutorial we'll be looking at a [ss-hogan](https://github.com/socketstream/ss-hogan), a wrapper for Twitter's [Hogan library](http://twitter.github.com/hogan.js/).

You can see the file structure for a template engine wrapper in the [ss-hogan repository]([ss-hogan](https://github.com/socketstream/ss-hogan)). Let's look at the key file, `engine.js`:

```javascript
/* lib/engine.js */

var hogan = require('hogan');

exports.init = function(root, config) {

  // Set global/window variable used to access templates from the browser
  var namespace = config && config.namespace || 'HT'

  return {

    name: 'Hogan',

    // Opening code to use when a Hogan template is called for the first time
    prefix: function() {
      return '<script type="text/javascript">if(!window.' + namespace + '){window.' + namespace + ' = {};}';
    },

    // Closing code once all Hogan templates have been written into the <script> tag
    suffix: function() {
      return '</script>';
    },

    // Compile template into a function and attach to window.<windowVar>
    process: function(template, path, id) {

      var compiledTemplate = hogan.compile(template, {asString: true});

      return 'window.' + namespace + '[\'' + id + '\'] = new Hogan.Template(' + compiledTemplate + ');';
    }
  }
}
```

Here `prefix` and `suffix` are called one time each. In between those calls, `process` gets called for every file this template engine handles.

In this example, the wrapper is compiling templates on the server side, then passing the compiled templates to the client. The `prefix` and `suffix` functions wrap the compiled templates inside a `<script>` tag, so that the templates are ready to use when the page loads.

### Selecting a Formatter

By default, SocketStream selects a formatter based on the template file's extension. If you want to change this behavior, you can add a `selectFormatter` function:

```javascript
/* lib/engine.js */

exports.init = function (root, config) {
  // ...
  return {
    // ...
    selectFormatter: function (path, formatters, defaultFormatter) {
      return defaultFormatter;
    },
    // ...
  }
};
```

* `path` is path of the template file relative to the `client/templates` folder.
* `formatters` is a map of formatters SocketStream already knows about:
    * Each key is a file extension (without a dot `.`)
    * Each value is a formatter for that extension type
* `defaultFormatter` is the formatter that SocketStream selects by default.

The formatter that `selectFormatter` returns is the formatter that SocketStream will use to render the template before passing it to the `process` function. If you return `false`, SocketStream will skip the formatter rendering process and pass along the template file raw instead.

### Tips

When building your own template wrapper be sure to consider the following points:

* Should you pre-compile the templates on the server before sending them over the wire? (generally a good idea)
* Does the browser need a VM (small client-side lib) to render the templates?

Try to pick the best trade off between performance and overall bytes sent to the client, bearing in mind it's not uncommon for a large app to have 50 or more templates.

If a client-side VM is needed to render the template (as is normally the case), be sure document this in your modules README file and provide a link. In the future we will make it possible to automatically send any client-side dependencies to the browser. Stay tuned.
