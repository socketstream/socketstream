# Session
# -------
# Creates and maintains a persistent session once a visitor connects over websockets
# Session data is also synched / cached on the front end server the client is connected to and sent along with every RPC request to avoid callbacks and constantly hammering the session store (e.g. Redis)
# The goal here is to ensure pressing refresh on the page, accidentally or otherwise, keeps you in the same session - regardless of which front server you connect to

EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter
util = require('util')
utils = require('./../utils')

# Store session information internally if Redis is not present
# Note internal store is for development/experimentation only, not production use
store_name = SS.redis && 'redis' || 'internal'
store = require("./session_storage/#{store_name}.coffee")

# Set constants
fields_to_store = ['id','user_id','channels','attributes']


# Session Class
# -------------
# A new instance of Session is created each time a websocket client connects or an API request is received
# Sessions created when using the API are not saved (at the moment)

  # Note: A unique @id will only be passed if the request originates over websockets

  #### Public methods

  # This method is called both by the constructor and each time an incoming websocket call is processed
  # It enables the nested namespaces ('user' and 'group') to access the current session object instead of the last one initialized by the constructor
  # For now this seems to be the best way to allow namespacing without storing separate copies the objects for each Session
  # Hopefully we will find a nicer way to do this in the future!
