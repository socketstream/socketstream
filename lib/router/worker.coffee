# ZeroMQ Router Worker
# --------------------
# Launched by the 'socketstream router' process manager which will restart this process should it die.
# The router performs the following functions:
#
# 1. Brokers requests from multiple front end processes to multiple back end processes
# 2. Proxies broadcast/channel/user messages from Redis to front end servers (so Redis can live on a protected subnet)
# 3. Issues commands to be run on back end servers at regular intervals
#
# Note: the router automatically starts when you launch the integrated 'socketstream server'
# For now there should only be one router worker process running in your cluster.
# Ideally the the host running this will have dual NICs and hence act as a firewall.
# As this is currently a single point of failure, the host running the router needs to be monitored carefully
# We will work hard to reduce all single points of failure in the future. ZeroMQ/scaling experts please get in touch :)
# Oh, and if you fancy writing this router in C or Erlang, please go ahead! We'd love to see the benchmarks :)
