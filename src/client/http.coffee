# Serve Views
# -----------
# Extend Node's HTTP http.ServerResponse object to serve views either from a cache (in production)
# or by generating them on-the-fly (in development)
# Note: Even though this is exactly what Express.js does, it's not best practice to extend Node's native
# objects and we don't be doing this in SocketStream 0.4
